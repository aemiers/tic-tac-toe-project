# Tic Tac Toe - Thanksgiving Edition
#### Anneke Miers

## Overview
Bored with the family over the Thanksgiving Break and don't have any games in your house? Tic Tac Toe - Thanksgiving Edition is the solution! This festively themed, two-player game is sure to cure all familial rivalries that bubble up over the holidays. Complete with a score tracker, turkey and pilgrim tokens, and winning messages, all players are sure to have a good time.

## Goals
Starting from scratch, the goal was to create a fully-functional game of Tic Tac Toe. Writing all of the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this project was a true evaluation of how far I've come as a developer.

My goals included making a beautiful, usable design using dry, cohesive CSS that applied styles to the page, applying styling rules to blocks of code.

The HTML should consist of consistent spacing and indentation, following the rules of the Turing Style Guide. HTML classes and IDs are used, as well as kebab-case.

The JavaScript has a separation of the data model logic and DOM logic, utilizing a Game class and a Player class. Code is dry and contains multiple instances of reusable functions.

## Technologies Used
HTML
CSS
JavaScript
MDN

## Code Architecture
During this project, I utilized a Game.js, a Player.js, and a Main.js. It was really cool to see how all of these different .js files were able to interact with eachother. I loved using the three different files because I felt like the code was organized between the three files.

The game.js file was utilized to hold all the information concerning the game and data model, the player.js was utilized to contain information about each individual player and their 'wins', and the main.js file was utilized to hold all information regarding the document object model (DOM).

## Challenges and Wins
The most challenging day for me on this project was Saturday. Nothing I did was working and I was starting to feel helpless. I believe that coding is as much of a confidence struggle as it is a logical one.

The issue I was confronting was alternating turns for players. I had written the code, but the results were always the same. Through a call with my mentor, I was able to realize the significance of pseudocoding. After taking an hour to write down every single step of the project and what that code would need, I started again, frequently referencing the pseudocode. Problems that seemed so huge and insurmountable became scalable, and I was able to proceed at a much faster pace than I was before.

## Reflections
In the future, I will always start a project with pseudocoding. Having a strategy to approach problems and then adjusting to the minute challenges is a far better way to proceed than throwing code at the wall and hoping something sticks.

An area of improvement for next time is cleaning up my code and breaking huge chunks down into smaller, dev friendly bits. I'm very disappointed with myself because of how big and complex some of my functions got. Once the code worked, I would just move on instead of refactoring right then and there. Now, it feels like my code is a huge knot that I have to untangle, and it's causing a lot of stress. I will not do this next time.
